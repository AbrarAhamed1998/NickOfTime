A game about a worn out, run of the mill, protagonist that is tired of the predictable villains that he comes across.

## About
This game is a 2D platformer/shooter style game that I initially created for GameOff22 game jam but eventually decided to work on it a little more as I fell in love with the idea.
The mechanics are simple. You pick up any gun that you find and start shooting away at anything you come across. The quirks are that the guns behave in a very cliche fashion. 

I've chosen the pixel art route for this game as I've always had a soft spot for the retro feel of pixel art in games. This was also to test my 2D art/animation skills which I still suck at but have slightly improved thanks to this game.
